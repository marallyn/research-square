## Technical Assessment

### Submitted by Jeff Martin on 05/04/2020

Clone repository, then execute:

```
php index.php
```

I spent about one hour completing the assessment. The actual coding of the
assessment was close to the suggested 30 minute limit, but with comments,
uploading to git, this README, and intermittent restarts due to home schooling
requirements, my total time increased.

My coding environment consists of a linux laptop, vscode, a docker
php:7.4-alpine container and google chrome.

Thanks and hope to hear from you soon.
